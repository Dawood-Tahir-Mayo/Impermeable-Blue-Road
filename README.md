# Impermeable Blue Road

## Overview
The Impermeable Blue Road is a **cement-free, highly durable, and water-resistant rigid pavement system**.  
Cement production accounts for nearly 8% of global CO₂ emissions. To reduce this impact, this project develops a road design that eliminates cement while providing **greater strength, impermeability, and durability** compared to traditional cement-based pavements.

The result is a sustainable and cost-efficient road system suitable for both urban and rural infrastructure.

## Project Type
ICAT Project (University Project – Civil Engineering)  
Field: Road Construction & Materials Engineering  
Focus: Sustainable, cement-free rigid pavement design  

## How It Works
1. **Cement-Free Construction:** Uses epoxy-ethylene essence, paraffin wax, and other additives instead of cement.  
2. **Impermeable Surface:** Prevents water infiltration, extending road life in all weather conditions.  
3. **Durability & Strength:** Performs better than ordinary cement rigid pavements under heavy traffic and stress.  
4. **Sustainability:** Eliminates cement use, lowering greenhouse gas emissions while reducing long-term maintenance costs.
