# Smart Street Lighting System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Smart Street Lighting System** that harnesses mechanical energy from vehicles using **piezoelectric materials** and converts it into electrical energy. The stored energy can be used to power street lights at night or even sold back to the power grid, promoting sustainable and energy-efficient urban infrastructure.


## Project Type
- **ICAT Project** (First-year university project)
- Field: Civil Engineering
- Focus: Energy conversion and sustainable infrastructure


## How It Works
1. **Piezoelectric Road**: A section of road embedded with piezoelectric materials generates electricity when vehicles pass over it.  
2. **Energy Storage**: Electrical energy generated is stored using **capacitors** and regulated with **diodes**.  
3. **Energy Utilization**:  
   - Powers street lights during the night.  
   - Excess energy can be sold back to the local power station.  

## Components Used
- Piezoelectric materials
- Capacitors
- Diodes
- Microcontroller/Arduino (optional for demonstration)
- LEDs (for street light simulation)


## Practical Demonstration
- Mechanical energy from cars → Piezoelectric sensors → Electrical energy stored → Street lights powered  
- The system is **sustainable**, **eco-friendly**, and demonstrates **energy recovery from everyday traffic**.


## Outcomes
- Converts mechanical energy to electrical energy efficiently  
- Reduces dependency on external power for street lighting  
- Promotes green energy solutions in urban infrastructure
