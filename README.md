# Smart Street Lighting System

This repository contains my project on developing a smart street lighting system powered through piezoelectric energy harvesting. The main idea behind this project was to convert the vibrations produced by vehicles on the road into electricity and use that energy to power LED street lights. By doing so, the system reduces dependency on conventional electricity sources and promotes the use of renewable energy in urban infrastructure.

The project covers different aspects including the design of piezoelectric plates, energy storage methods, and the connection to LED street lights. I also carried out testing to measure the output efficiency of the plates and to analyze how much power could realistically be generated from road vibrations.

Inside this repository, you will find:
- **Reports** – full documentation, design approach, and calculations  
- **Data** – piezoelectric output results and performance tests  
- **Diagrams** – circuit layouts and system designs  
- **Photos** – images of prototypes, components, and testing process  

This project gave me hands-on experience with sustainable energy applications and strengthened my interest in developing smart, eco-friendly infrastructure solutions. It also taught me the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with practical testing to evaluate the feasibility of an idea.
